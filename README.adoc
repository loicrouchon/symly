== Symly, centralize sparse file trees

Symly is a tool helping to centralize sparse file trees.
It replicates and maintains a file tree structure of one or more `repository` layers into a `directory` by creating symbolic links.

* *Layers*: Symly supports the definition of multiple repositories.
  Those repositories will be combined in an overriding fashion similar to what is done by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OverlayFS[OverlayFS].
* *No database*: the filesystem is the state
* *Backup, Sharing, and Synchronization tool of your choice*: Symly replicates the file tree of the repositories inside another file tree using symbolic links.
 But it doesn't provide a way to share, synchronize, or back up the content of the repositories.
You can then decide to use one or more tools of your choice for this task: git, rsync, Dropbox, Tresorit, ...
