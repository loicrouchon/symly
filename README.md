# Symly

Symly is a tool helping to replicate and maintain the file structure of a `repository` into a
directory `source directory` by creating symbolic links.

For example, consider the following directory `~/my/repository`:

```
~/my/repository
 |-- .bashrc
 |-- .gitconfig
 >-- .config
     |-- starship.toml
     >-- fish
         |-- config.fish
```

By using symly, you can automatically create links from `~` to all files in `~/my/repository`.

```
> symly link -r ~/my/repository
```

This would result in the following links:

```
~/.bashrc                   ->  ~/my/repository/.bashrc
~/.gitconfig                ->  ~/my/repository/.gitconfig
~/.config/starship.toml     ->  ~/my/repository/.config/starship.toml
~/.config/fish/config.fish  ->  ~/my/repository/.config/fish/config.fish
```

## What is symly useful for?

The Symly tool has been created to address the synchronization issue of user's configuration files between different
machines. But Symly is not a synchronization tool, nor is limited to deal with user configuration files.

> *Symly is not a synchronization tool.*

### There are many synchronization tools out there, how is Symly different?

Symly is not a synchronization tool. Symly is a tool allowing you to centralize a list of files and directories and to
create symbolic links to them. You can then use your preferred synchronization tool whether it is a service like
Dropbox, Tresorit, or a more developer and versioning-oriented tool like git.

### Why creating symbolic links and not copy the files over?

The main use case of symly is about user configuration files. The particularity of those files is that they are not
read-only. They are written to by a wide variety of tools like your preferred text-editor, scripts appending to
your `.bashrc`, other tools like `git config --global`, ... Using a file copy would destroy such updates every time you
want to deploy your centralized files.

* **Seamless integration**:
  by using symbolic links every change to tracked files will be immediately and available in the repository, no
  matter the tool used to edit the files.
* **Synchronization/Versioning ready**:
  Any versioning or synchronization tool can be used on the repository. Gain instant benefit from your favorite
  tool diffs and rollbacks for your files.

### Is Symly limited to user configuration files?

No, Symly is not limited to creating links in your user home folder. The user home folder is a sensible default for
the `destination` but any `destination` can be used.

## Usage

```
Usage: symly [-hv] [COMMAND]
symly create links
-h, --help      Prints this help message and exits
-v, --verbose   Be verbose.
Commands:
link        Synchronizes the links from the repositories to the source directory
```

### The `link` subcommand

The `link` subcommand is the main subcommand that will perform the linking.

```
Usage: symly link [--dry-run] [-d=<destination>] -t=<repositories>...
```

* Links every file from `repositories` into `source` by preserving the structure.

```
> tree ~/my/repository
~/my/repository
 |-- .bashrc
 |-- .gitconfig
 >-- .config
     |-- starship.toml
     >-- fish
         |-- config.fish

> symly link -r ~/my/repository

Creating links from [~/my/repository] to ~
[CREATE] ~/.bashrc -> ~/my/repository/.bashrc
[CREATE] ~/.gitconfig -> ~/my/repository/.gitconfig
[CREATE] ~/.config/starship.toml -> ~/my/repository/.config/starship.toml
[CREATE] ~/.config/fish/config.fish -> ~/my/repository/.config/fish/config.fish
```  

* Supports multiple `repositories`: The first repository defining a link has the priority, defaults are last

```
> tree ~/my/repositories
~/my/repositories
 |-- custom
 |   |-- .gitconfig
 |   >-- .bashrc
 >-- defaults
     |-- .gitconfig
     >-- .config
        >-- starship.toml

> symly link -r ~/my/repositories/custom ~/my/repositories/defaults

Creating links from [~/my/repositories/custom, ~/my/repositories/defaults] to ~
[CREATE] ~/.bashrc -> ~/my/repositories/custom/.bashrc
[CREATE] ~/.gitconfig -> ~/my/repositories/custom/.gitconfig
[CREATE] ~/.config/starship.toml -> ~/my/repositories/defaults/.config/starship.toml
```  

* Supports directory linking when a `.symlink` file is present in the directory.

```
> tree ~/my/repository
~/my/repository
 >-- .config
     >-- fish
         |-- .symlink
         >-- config.fish

> symly link -r ~/my/repository

Creating links from [~/my/repository] to ~
[CREATE] ~/.config/fish -> ~/my/repository/.config/fish
```  

## Terminology

The terminology examples will be given by considering the following file structure:

```
~
 |-- .gitconfig         -> ~/repositories/custom/.gitconfig
 |-- .bashrc            -> ~/repositories/custom/.bashrc
 >-- .config
     >-- starship.toml  -> ~/repositories/defaults/config/starship.toml

~/repositories
 |-- custom
 |   |-- .gitconfig
 |   >-- .bashrc
 >-- defaults
     |-- .gitconfig
     >-- .config
        >-- starship.toml
```

**Destination**:

A directory in which a `repository`  file structure will be linked.

Example: `~`


**Repository**:
A directory containing a file structure to link into a `source directory`.

Example: `~/repositories/custom`, `~/repositories/defaults`

**Link**:

A link is composed of two attributes:

* **source**: The path of the link.
* **target**: The path pointed by the link.

It is materialized on the file system as a [symbolic link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link).

For example: `~/.config/starship.toml -> ~/repositories/defaults/.config/starship.toml`

Those two attributes can be determined from the _source directory, and the repository_ using a third one: the _link name_
.

The **link name** is the common part of the path between the link source and target. It is both:

* The relative path of a link source to its source directory.
* The relative path of a link target to its repository.

Example:

* `.gitconfig` for link `~/.gitconfig -> ~/repositories/custom/.gitconfig`
* `.config/starship.toml` for link `~/.config/starship.toml -> ~/repositories/defaults/.config/starship.toml`

### Summary

Here is how all the previous notions play together:

```
 ~                 /  .config/starship.toml  ->  ~/repositories/defaults  /  .config/starship.toml
[SOURCE DIRECTORY] / [NAME                 ] -> [REPOSITORY             ] / [NAME                 ]
[SOURCE                                    ] -> [TARGET                                           ]
```

## Installation

Native binaries for Linux (x64) and macOS (x64) can be downloaded directly
from [github](https://github.com/loicrouchon/symly/tags). It is intended to provide symly as `.deb`, `.rpm` packages and
through Homebrew in a near future.

## Build

You can also clone this repository and build Symly using the instructions below:

### Pre-requisites

* JDK 11

### Packaging and running the application

The application can be built using the `installDist` task:

```shell script
./gradlew clean build installDist
```

This will install the application locally in the `./build/install/symly/`. The application can be run
using `./build/install/symly/bin/symly <ARGS>` or using `./build/install/symly/bin/symly.bat` on windows.

```
> ./build/install/symly/bin/symly

Usage: symly [-hv] [COMMAND]
symly create links
  -h, --help      Prints this help message and exits
  -v, --verbose   Be verbose.
Commands:
  link  link
```

### Advanced packaging options

### Creating a distribution

The `assembleDist` task allow to build a `tar` and a `zip` distribution archives:

```shell script
./gradlew clean build assembleDist
```

This result in two self-contained archive which only requires a JRE to be installed resulting. The archives are located
here:

* `build/distributions/symly-${version}.tar`
* `build/distributions/symly-${version}.zip`

Once unzipped/untarred, the application can be run using the same `bin/link`/`bin/symly.bat` launch script as above.

#### Creating a native package containing the JVM

##### Prerequisites

* A JDK 14 or above is required

The `buildNativePackage` task allow to build a native package installer that will contain the application as well as the
JRE.

```shell script
./gradlew clean build buildNativePackage
```

The native package will be located in `build` and can be installed with regular system package manager.

#### Creating a native executable

##### Prerequisites

* You must have GraalVM installed in a version supporting Java 11.
* The `GRAALVM_HOME` must point to GraalVM installation directory.
* `$PATH` must include `$GRAALVM_HOME/bin`
* `native-image` must have been installed using `gu install native-image`

##### Building the native executable

You can create a native executable using the `buildNativeImage` task:

```shell script
./gradlew clean buildNativeImage
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./build/libs/symly <ARGS>`
