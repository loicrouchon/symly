  -V, --version   Prints version information.
Commands:
  link, ln    Create/update/delete links from 'directory' to the 'repositories'.

              Repositories should be specified with base layers first and
                overriding layers next. In case two repositories contain a file
                with the same path, the file in the latest repository will be
                used as the target for the link for the given path
  status, st  Displays the current links' synchronization status
  unlink      Remove links in the 'directory' pointing to the 'repositories'.

              Note this operation does not restore files in the destination. If
                that is the desired behavior, use the 'restore' command instead.
