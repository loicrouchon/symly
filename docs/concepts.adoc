= Concepts

Symly is based on the following major concepts:

* The _*repositories*_: Repositories are folders containing a file structured to be linked in a _directory_.
For example `/some/path`, `~/repositories/defaults`. *You can specify one or more repositories*.
Each repository acts as its own layer, overriding previous layers with its content.
* The _*directory*_: The folder in which the _repositories_ content will be linked.
For example `~`.

Consider the following repository file structure:

----
~/repository
  |-- .gitconfig
  >-- .config
      >-- starship.toml
----

When linked with symly in the `~` directory, the following links will be created:

----
~/.gitconfig             -> ~/repository/.gitconfig
~/.config/starship.toml  -> ~/repository/config/starship.toml
----

_Links_ are composed of two attributes:

* *source*: The path of the link.
* *target*: The path pointed by the link.

They are materialized on the file system as [symbolic links](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link).

For example: `~/.config/starship.toml -> ~/repository/.config/starship.toml`

Those two attributes can be determined from the _directory_, and the _repository_ using a third one: the _link name_.

The _link name_ is the common part of the path between the link source and target.
It is both:

* The relative path of a link source to its main directory.
* The relative path of a link target to its repository.

Example:

* `.gitconfig` for link `~/.gitconfig -> ~/repository/.gitconfig`
* `.config/starship.toml` for link `~/.config/starship.toml -> ~/repository/.config/starship.toml`

== Summary

Here is how all the previous notions play together:

----
 ~          /  .config/starship.toml  ->  ~/repositories/defaults  /  .config/starship.toml
[DIRECTORY] / [NAME                 ] -> [REPOSITORY             ] / [NAME                 ]
[SOURCE                             ] -> [TARGET                                           ]
----

== The "repository file tree is the state" principle

On top of those concept, an important principle applies:

> _*The repository file tree is the state*_

This principle is has the following implications:

* No command to add a file to a repository, just drop it there
* No command to delete a file from a repository, just delete it
* No command to edit a file in a repository, just edit it directly or through its symbolic link in the directory.
This allows for Seamless integration with tools modifying dotfiles directly on the directory (like git config user.name ..., â€¦)
* Immediate visibility on modifications made on the directory files

'''

Let's put those concepts into application by looking at the link:usage.adoc[usage manual].
