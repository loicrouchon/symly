$ symly link --help
Usage: symly link [-fhv] [--dry-run] [-d=<main-directory>]
                  [--max-depth=<max-depth>] [-r[=<repositories>...]]...
Create/update/delete links from 'directory' to the 'repositories'.

Repositories should be specified with base layers first and overriding layers
next. In case two repositories contain a file with the same path, the file in
the latest repository will be used as the target for the link for the given path
  -d, --dir, --directory=<main-directory>
                  Main directory in which links will be created. If not given
                    as a command line argument, symly will look for the
                    'directory' property in the symly.config file present in
                    the current working directory
      --dry-run   Do not create links but only displays which ones would be
                    created
  -f, --force     Force existing files and directories to be overwritten
                    instead of failing in case of conflicts
  -h, --help      Prints this help message and exits
      --max-depth=<max-depth>
                  Depth of the lookup for orphans deletion.If not given as a
                    command line argument, symly will look for the 'orphans.
                    max-depth.search' property in the symly.config file present
                    in the current working directory. If no property is found,
                    default value will be used.
                    Default: 2
  -r, --repositories[=<repositories>...]
                  Repositories containing files to link in the main directory.
                    Repositories are to be listed by decreasing priority as the
                    first ones will override the content of the later ones. If
                    not given as a command line argument, symly will look for
                    the 'repositories' property in the symly.config file
                    present in the current working directory
  -v, --verbose   Be verbose.
