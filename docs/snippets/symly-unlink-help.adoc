$ symly unlink --help
Usage: symly unlink [-hv] [--dry-run] [-d=<main-directory>]
                    [--max-depth=<max-depth>] [-r[=<repositories>...]]...
Remove links in the 'directory' pointing to the 'repositories'.

Note this operation does not restore files in the destination. If that is the
desired behavior, use the 'restore' command instead.

  -d, --dir, --directory=<main-directory>
                  Main directory in which links will be created. If not given
                    as a command line argument, symly will look for the
                    'directory' property in the symly.config file present in
                    the current working directory
      --dry-run   Do not actually remove links but only displays which ones
                    would be removed
  -h, --help      Prints this help message and exits
      --max-depth=<max-depth>
                  Depth of the lookup for orphans deletion.If not given as a
                    command line argument, symly will look for the 'orphans.
                    max-depth.search' property in the symly.config file present
                    in the current working directory. If no property is found,
                    default value will be used.
                    Default: 2
  -r, --repositories[=<repositories>...]
                  Repositories containing files to link in the main directory.
                    Repositories are to be listed by decreasing priority as the
                    first ones will override the content of the later ones. If
                    not given as a command line argument, symly will look for
                    the 'repositories' property in the symly.config file
                    present in the current working directory
  -v, --verbose   Be verbose.
